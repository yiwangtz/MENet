### Overview


Salient object detection (SOD) aims to mimic the human
visual system (HVS) and cognition mechanisms to identify
and segment salient objects. However, due to the complexity
of these mechanisms, current methods are not perfect.
Accuracy and robustness need to be further improved, particularly
in complex scenes with multiple objects and background
clutter. To address this issue, we propose a novel
approach called Multiple Enhancement Network (MENet)
that adopts the boundary sensibility, content integrity, iterative
refinement, and frequency decomposition mechanisms
of HVS. A multi-level hybrid loss is firstly designed
to guide the network to learn pixel-level, region-level, and
object-level features. A flexible multiscale feature enhancement
module (ME-Module) is then designed to gradually
aggregate and refine global or detailed features by changing
the size order of the input feature sequence. An iterative
training strategy is used to enhance boundary features
and adaptive features in the dual-branch decoder of
MENet. Comprehensive evaluations on six challenging
benchmark datasets show that MENet achieves state-of-theart
results. Both the codes and results are publicly available
at https://github.com/yiwangtz/MENet.
